2. (Not required if you have your joins set to everyone on your main account) Make sure your alt account is friends with your main account and make sure you are already ingame.
3. Open your profile page: click your profile in the top-left corner of a Roblox page, or manually go `https://www.roblox.com/users/YOUR_USER_ID` (replace `YOUR_USER_ID` with your actual Roblox user ID).
4. Click the extension icon in the top-right corner, however if any issues occur, the extension should display a notification telling you what happened and how to resolve the issue.
5. Log into your alt account (you can use saved passwords). No, I am not going to steal your Roblox account, this is the official Roblox login page, just check the URL bar at the top.
